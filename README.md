# NEWS PRESS BLOG APP

 A web application that is built using the Flask framework, SQLite database, HTML, CSS, Jinja templating engine, and Python programming language.

The application will likely be designed to provide a platform for creating, publishing, and managing news articles and blog posts. Flask provides the framework for building and deploying the web application, while SQLite serves as the database to store the articles and other relevant data.

HTML, CSS, and Jinja will be used to create the user interface, design the layout and style of the pages, and display the articles and other data stored in the database. Finally, Python will be used as the primary programming language for the application, providing the logic for retrieving and processing data, handling user interactions, and performing other tasks.

Overall, the combination of these technologies will allow for the creation of a dynamic and interactive news and blog platform that provides a seamless user experience and integrates with the underlying data storage and processing systems.
